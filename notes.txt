React is a JavaScript Library. The name ‘React’ was chosen
because the library was designed to allow developers to react
to changes in state and data within an application, and to
update the user interface in a declarative and efficient
manner.


What is Library?
Library is a collections of prewritten code snippets that can
be used and reused to perform certain tasks. A particular
JavaScript library code can be plugged into application code
which leads to faster development and fewer vulnerabilities to
have errors.
Examples: React, jQuery

What is Framework?
Framework provides a basic foundation or structure for a
website or an application.
Inception! ( Namaste-React ) 3
Examples: Angular


 Similarities between Library and Framework?
Frameworks and libraries are code written by third parties to
solve regular/common problems or to optimise performance.

 Difference between Library and Framework?
A key difference between the two is Inversion of control. When
using a library, the control remains with the developer who
tells the application when to call library functions. When
using a framework, the control is reversed, which means that
the framework tells the developer where code needs to be
provided and calls it as it requires.


Cross Origin:
 The crossorigin attribute in the script tag enables CrossOrigin Resource Sharing (CORS) for loading external JavaScript
files from different origin than the hosting web page. This
allows the script to access resources from the server hosting
the script, such as making HTTP requests or accessing data.

What is {} denotes in above code?

Whenever
I'm passing inside {}, will go as tag attributes of h1.

eg: <div id="root">
<h1 id="title">Hello world</h1>
</div>

This (id='title'), classes, etc should come under {}. 


React will overwrite everything inside "root" and
replaces with whatever given inside render.
